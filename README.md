This repository helps to track my progress in the book 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs' by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman.

## Description

This is entirely for me to track my own progress. As I am only self-learning this book, the solutions for the exercises may not be fully correct. This repo currently only includes exercises for Chapter 1 and less than half of Chapter 2 as it is still a work in progress. It also includes Useful Functions containing procedures which may be helpful in certain chapters. Over time, more exercises will be added into this repo as I progress further into the book. 

_**note: Chapter 1 folder has missing exercises as I've only started compiling these exercises halfway through Chapter 2. Will sort this out soon.**_

In the Exercises directory, each exercise aims to include:
* Code for the solution
* Code documentation (eg. comments explaining the required arguments and expected return values)
* Tests and output

For clearer answers, do visit the last two links I've provided under the Acknowledgement header, or any other sites online which provide full and guided solutions.
