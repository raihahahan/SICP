This repository helps to track my progress in the book 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs' by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman.

## Description

This is entirely for me to track my own progress. As I am only self-learning this book, the solutions for the exercises may not be fully correct. This repo currently only includes exercises for Chapter 1 and less than half of Chapter 2 as it is still a work in progress. It also includes Useful Functions containing procedures which may be helpful in certain chapters. Over time, more exercises will be added into this repo as I progress further into the book.
